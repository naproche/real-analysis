Signature. A complex number is a notion.

Signature. Let a and b be elements. (a,b) is an element.

Definition. Let a and b be real numbers. (a,b) is a complex number.

Signature. Let x and y be complex numbers. x +com y is a notion.

Signature. Let x and y be complex numbers. x *com y is a notion.

Axiom. Let a,b,c,d be real numbers. Take complex numbers
(a,b) and (c,d). (a,b) +com (c,d) = (a + c, b + d).

Axiom. Let a,b,c,d be real numbers. (a,b) *com (c,d) = (a*c-b*d, a*d+b*c).
