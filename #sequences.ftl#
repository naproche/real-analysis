### Sequence 1/n converges to 0 and has infinite range

Lemma. 
    Let a be a sequence such that for every n
        ((If n = 0 then a(n) = 2) and (If n != 0 then a(n) = 1/n)).
    Then a converges to 0 and a has infinite range.
Proof.
    Let us show that a converges to 0.
        Let eps be a positive real number. 
        Take N such that 1 < N * eps.

        Let us show that for every n such that N < n |a(n)| < eps.
          Let n be a natural number such that N < n. Then n != 0.
            Let us show that 1/n < eps.
                We have N * eps < n * eps.
                Hence 1 < n * eps.

                1/n is positive.
                Hence 1/n * 1 < 1/n * (n * eps).
                We have 1/n * 1 = 1/n.
                1/n * (n * eps) = (1/n * n) * eps
                                = 1 * eps 
                                = eps.
            end.
            Hence |a(n)| = 1/n < eps.
         end.
    end.

    Let us show that a has infinite range.
        Assume the contrary.
        Take N such that ran(a) = ranN(a,N).
        Then a(N + 1) is an element of ran(a).

        Let us show that a(N + 1) is not an element of ranN(a,N).
            Let us show that for every n such that n <= N a(n) != a(N + 1).
                Assume the contrary.
                Take n such that n <= N and a(n) = a(N + 1).
                Case n = 0.
                    We have 2 = 1/(N + 1).

                    (2 * N) + 2 .= (2 * N) + (2 * 1)
                                .= 2 * (N + 1)
                                .= 1/(N + 1) * (N + 1)
                                .= 1.

                    We have (2 * N) + 2 > 1.
                    Contradiction.
                end.
                Case n != 0.
                    We have N + 1 != 0.
                    Then 1/n  = 1/(N + 1).
                    Then 1/(1/n) = 1/(1/(N + 1)).
                    Hence n = N + 1.
                    Contradiction.
                end.
            end.
            Hence a(N + 1) is not an element of ranN(a,N).
        end.                                   

        Contradiction.

### Sequence (-1)^n diverges and has finite range.

Signature Parity.
    n is even is an atom.

Let n is odd stand for not (n is even).

Axiom ParityPlusOne.
    n is even iff n + 1 is odd.

Axiom ZeroEven. 0 is even.

Lemma OneOdd. 1 is odd.

Lemma.
    Let a be a sequence such that for every n (((n is even) => a(n) = 1) and ((n is odd) => a(n) = -1)).
    Then a diverges and a has finite range.
Proof.
    Let us show that a diverges.
        Assume the contrary.
        Take a real number x such that a converges to x.
        Take N such that for every n such that N < n dist(a(n),x) < 1.

        Let us show that dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) = 2.
            Case N + 1 is even.
                Then (N + 2) is odd.
                Hence dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) = dist(1,-1) = |1+1| = 2.
            end.
            Case N + 1 is odd.
                Then N + 2 is even.
                Hence dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) = dist(-1,1) = |-1-1|= 2.
            end.
        end.

        a(N + 1) is a real number and a(N + 2) is a real number.
        We have dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) <= dist(a(N + 1),x) + dist(x,a(N + 2)).
        We have dist(x,a(N + 2)) = dist(a(N + 2),x).
        Hence dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) <= dist(a(N + 1),x) + dist(a(N + 2),x).

        We have dist(a(N + 1),x) < 1 and dist(a(N + 2),x) < 1.
        Hence dist(a(N + 1),x) + dist(a(N + 2),x) <  dist(a(N + 1),x) + 1 < 1 + 1.
        Hence dist(a(N + 1),a(N + 2)) < 2.
        Hence 2 < 2.
        Contradiction.
    end.

    Let us show that a has finite range.
        Let us show that ran(a) = ranN(a,1).
            Let us show that every element of ranN(a,1) is an element of ran(a).
                Let x be an element of ranN(a,1).
                Take n such that n <= 1 and a(n) = x.
                Hence x is an element of ran(a).
            end.

            Let us show that every element of ran(a) is an element of ranN(a,1).
                Let x be an element of ran(a).

                Let us show that x = 1 or x = -1.
                    Take n such that a(n) = x.
                    n is even or n is odd.
                    Hence x = 1 or x = -1.
                end.

                We have a(0) = 1.
                We have a(1) = -1.

               Case x = 1.
                    Then x = a(0).
                    We have 0 <= 1.
                    Hence x is an element of ranN(a,1).
                end.
                Case x = -1.
                    Then x = a(1).
                    We have 1 <= 1.
                    Hence x is an element of ranN(a,1).

    Let eps be a positive real number. Let x be a real number.
    Neighb(x,eps) = {y | y is a real number such that dist(y,x) < eps}.

Theorem ConvNeighborhood.
    Let a be a sequence. Let x be a real number.
    a converges to x iff for every positive real number eps there exists a N
    such that for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps).
Proof.
    Let us show that (If a converges to x then for every positive real number eps there exists a N
    such that for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps)).
        Assume a converges to x.
        Let eps be a positive real number.
        Take N such that for every n such that N < n dist(a(n),x) < eps.
        Hence for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps).
    end.
    
    Let us show that (If for every positive real number eps there exists a N such that
    for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps) then a converges to x).
        Assume for every positive real number eps there exists a N such that
            for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps).
        Let eps be a positive real number.
        Take N such that for every n such that N < n a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,eps).
        Hence for every n such that N < n dist(a(n),x) < eps (by Neighb).

### Limit is unique

Lemma DistEqual.
    Let x and y be real numbers. Assume for every positive real number eps dist(x,y) < eps.
    Then x = y.
Proof.
	Assume the contrary. Then dist(x,y) != 0. |x-y| > 0. Then dist(x,y)//2 is a positive real number. 
	Then dist(x,y)//2 < (dist(x,y)//2) +  (dist(x,y)//2) =  dist(x,y).
   Contradiction.

Theorem LimitUnique.
    Let a be a sequence. Let x, y be real numbers. Assume a converges to x and a converges to y.
    Then x = y.
Proof.
    Let us show that for every positive real number eps dist(x,y) < eps.
        Let eps be a positive real number.
        Take a positive real number halfeps such that halfeps = 1/2 * eps.

        Take N1 such that for every n such that N1 < n dist(a(n),x) < halfeps.
        Take N2 such that for every n such that N2 < n dist(a(n),y) < halfeps.

        For every n dist(x,y) <= dist(x,a(n)) + dist(a(n),y). 
        Take N3 such that N3 = max(N1,N2) + 1.
        Then N1 < N3 and N2 < N3.

        Hence dist(x,a(N3)) < halfeps and dist(a(N3),y) < halfeps.
        Hence dist(x,a(N3)) + dist(a(N3),y) <  dist(x,a(N3)) + halfeps < halfeps + halfeps.
        Hence dist(x,y) <= dist(x,a(N3)) + dist(a(N3),y) < halfeps + halfeps = eps.
    end.
    Therefore x = y.

Definition BoundedSequence. 
  Let a be a sequence. a is bounded iff there exists a real number K such
  that a is bounded by K.

Signature MaxN.
  Let a be sequence. maxN(a,N) is a real number such that (there exists n such that n<=N and
  maxN(a,N)=a(n)) and (for every n such that n<=N a(n)<=maxN(a,N)). 

Theorem ConvergentImpBounded. 
  Let a be a sequence. Assume that a converges. Then a is bounded.
Proof.
    Take a real number x such that a converges to x.
    Take N such that for every n such that N < n dist(a(n),x) < 1.

    Define b(k) = |a(k)| for k in NN. b is a sequence.
    Take a real number K such that K = max(1 + |x|, maxN(b,N)).

    Let us show that a is bounded by K.
        Let us show that for every n |a(n)| <= K. 
            Let n be a natural number.
            We have n <= N or n > N.
            Case n <= N.
                We have |a(n)| = b(n) <= maxN(b,N).
                We have maxN(b,N) <= K.
                Therefore |a(n)| <= K.
            end.
            Case n > N.
                We have dist(a(n),x) < 1.
                We have 1 + |x| <= K.

                |a(n)| = |a(n) + 0| = |a(n) + (x - x)| = |(a(n) - x) + x|.

                Hence |a(n)| <= |a(n) - x| + |x|.
                Hence |a(n)| <= dist(a(n),x) + |x|.

                We have dist(a(n),x) + |x| < 1 + |x|.
                Hence |a(n)| <= 1 + |x|.
                Therefore |a(n)| <= K.
            end.
        end.
        Hence a is bounded by K.

Definition LimitPointOfSet. 
  Let E be a set. Assume every element of E is a real number. A limit point of E is a real number x
  such that for every positive real number eps there exists an element y of E such that y is an 
  element of Neighb(x,eps) and y !=x.

Theorem ConvLimitPoint.
    Let E be a set. Assume every element of E is a real number. Let x be a limit point of E.
    Then there exists a sequence a such that a converges to x and for every n a(n) is an element of E.
Proof.
    Let us show that for every n such that n > 0 there exists an element y of E such that
    y is an element of Neighb(x,1/n) and y != x.
        Let n be a natural number such that n > 0.
        Then 1/n is a positive real number.
        Take an element y of E such that y is an element of Neighb(x,1/n)
            and y != x.
    end.

    Define a(n) = Case n = 0 -> Choose an element y of E such that y is an element of
                                Neighb(x,1) and y != x in y,
                  Case n > 0 -> Choose an element y of E such that y is an element of
                                Neighb(x,1/n) and y != x in y
    for n in NN.
    a is a sequence.

    Then for every n a(n) is an element of E.
    Let us show that a converges to x.
        Let eps be a positive real number.
        Take N such that 1 < N * eps.

        Let us show that for every n such that N < n dist(a(n),x) < eps.
            Let n be a natural number such that n > N. Then n != 0.
            Then a(n) is an element of E such that a(n) is an element of Neighb(x,1/n).
            Hence dist(a(n),x) < 1/n.

            Let us show that 1/n < eps.
                We have N * eps < n * eps.
                Hence 1 < n * eps.

                1/n is positive.
                Hence 1/n * 1 < 1/n * (n * eps).
                We have 1/n * 1 = 1/n.
                1/n * (n * eps) .= (1/n * n) * eps
                                   .= 1 * eps
                                   .= eps.

        We have |(a(n) - x) + (b(n) - y)| <= |a(n) - x| + |b(n) - y|.

        Hence dist(a(n),x) + dist(b(n),y) < halfeps +  dist(b(n),y) < halfeps + halfeps.
        Hence |(a(n) + b(n)) - (x + y)| <= dist(a(n),x) + dist(b(n),y) <  halfeps + halfeps.
        Hence |(a(n) + b(n)) - (x + y)| <  halfeps + halfeps = eps.

  Let a be a sequence. Let x,c be real numbers. Assume a converges to x. Then c*'a converges to c*x.
Proof.
    Case c=0.
        We have c*x=0.
        Let us show that for every natural number n (c*'a)(n)=0.
          Let n be a natural number.

      Let us show that for every n such that N<n dist(c*(a(n)), c*x)< eps.
        Let n be natural number. Assume N<n.
        |(c*a(n))-(c*x)|  .=|c*(a(n)-x)| (by Dist2)
                          .=|c|*|(a(n)-x)| (by MultAbs).
        |c|*dist(a(n),x)<|c|*oneovereps.
        Hence |(c*a(n))-(c*x)|<|c|*oneovereps.
        |c|*oneovereps  = |c|*(1/(|c|)*eps) = (|c|*1/(|c|))*eps = 1*eps = eps.
