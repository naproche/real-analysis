Signature. Let p,q be elements. d(p,q) is a real number.

Signature. A metric space is a set.

Axiom 2_15_a1. Let X be a metric space. Let p be an element of X. d(p,p)=0.
Axiom 2_15_a2. Let X be a metric space. Let p and q be elements of X. d(p,q) >= 0.
Axiom 2_15_b. Let X be a metric space. Let p and q be elements of X. d(p,q)=d(q,p).
Axiom 2_15_c.  Let X be a metric space. Let p, q and r be elements of X. d(p,q) <= d(p,r) + d(r,q).

Axiom 2_16. Let X be a metric space. Let Y be a subset of X. Y is a metric space.

#This holds as the axioms are still satisfied. I do not know if we can ask Naproche to prove this as 
#we have not specified what a metric space actually is, just stated what properties should it have.

Definition 2_17_a. Let a and b be real numbers. Seg(a,b)= {x | (x is a real number) and (x>a) 
and (x< b)}.

Definition 2_17_b. Let a and b be real numbers. Int(a,b)= {x | (x is a real number) and (x>=a) 
and (x<=b)}.
