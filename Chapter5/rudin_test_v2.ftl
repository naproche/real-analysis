Lemma.
  Let x < y.
  (x|y) is the interior of [x|y]. 
Proof.
  (x|y) is subset of [x|y].
  (x|y) is open interval.
  Let us show that there exists no subset S of [x|y] such that
  (x|y) is proper subset of S and S is open interval.
    Assume the contrary.
    Take subset S of [x|y] such that (x|y) is proper subset of S and S is open interval.
    Take real numbers x',y' such that S = (x'|y'). 
    Then (x > x' and y' >= y) or (x >= x' or y < y'). Indeed (x|y) is proper subset of S.
    x <= x' and y' <= y. 
    Proof by contradiction.
      Let us show that if x' < x then contradiction.
        Assume x' < x.
        Take z such that x' < z < x.
        z belongs to S and z does not belong to [x|y].

#Lemma. Contradiction.

#being "real valued" is too general and encompasses cases which are
#not important for the present formalization i.e a punctuated function
#or when Dom(f) is a singleton. These cases mean that we cannot approach 
#a given point in the domain with arbitrary degree of closeness. Therefore
#the concept of limit is somewhat vague and those cases should be ruled out.

Lemma Fredy.
  Let a be a positive real number.
  Assume that for every positive real number e  
  |x-y| <= a*e. 
  Then x = y.
Proof.
  Assume |x-y| != 0. 
  Then |x-y|>0.
  1/a * |x-y| is a positive real number.
  Take positive real number e such that
  e < 1/a * |x-y|.
  a*e < (a * 1/a) *|x-y| = |x-y|.
  Then |x-y| <= a*e < |x-y|.
end.

Lemma.
  Let f be real valued.
  Let y1, y2 be real numbers.
  Assume y1, y2 is limit of f at x and
  for every positive real number d
  there exists z \in Dom(f) such that
  0 < |z - x| < d.
  Then y1 = y2.
Proof.
  Let us show that for every positive real number e |y1 - y2| <= (1+1)*e.
    Let e be a positive real number.
    Take positive real number d1 such that  for every real number z
       if z \in Dom(f) and 0 < |z - x| < d1
      then |f(z) - y1| < (e) (by Limit).
    Take positive real number d2
    such that for every real number z
       if z \in Dom(f) and 0 < |z - x| < d2
      then |f(z) - y2| < (e) (by Limit).
    Take a positive real number d such that
    d < d1 and d < d2.
    Take element z such that
    z belongs to Dom(f) and
    0 < |z - x| < d.
  
    Then |f(z) - y1| <= (e).
    Then |f(z) - y2| <= (e).
    
    Let us show that |y1 - y2| <=  e + e.
      Let us show that |y1 - y2| <= |f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|.
        |y1 - y2| = |(y1 + ((-f(z)) + f(z))) - y2|.
        (y1 + ((-f(z)) + f(z))) - y2 = (y1 + (-f(z))) + (f(z) - y2).
        Then |(y1 + ((-f(z)) + f(z))) - y2| = |(y1 + (-f(z))) + (f(z) - y2)|.
        (y1 + (-f(z))) + (f(z) - y2) = (y1 - f(z)) + (f(z) - y2).
        Then |(y1 + (-f(z))) + (f(z) - y2)| = |(y1 - f(z)) + (f(z) - y2)|.
        |(y1 - f(z)) + (f(z) - y2)| <= |y1 - f(z)| + |f(z) -  y2| (By TriangleIneq).
        |y1 -  f(z)| + |f(z) - y2| = |f(z) - y1| + |f(z) - y2|.
      End.
      Let us show that  |f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2| <= e + e.
        |f(z) - y1| <= (e).
        Hence |f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2| <= (e) + |f(z) -  y2|.
        |f(z) - y2| <= (e).
        Hence e + |f(z) -  y2| <= (e) + (e).
      End.      
      If |y1 - y2| <= (|f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|)
      and (|f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|) <= e + e then 
      |y1 - y2| <=  e + e.  
      Proof.
        For every real number x',y',z'
        if x' <= y' and y' <= z' then x' <= z'.
        |y1 - y2| is a real number.
        (|f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|) is a real number.
        e + e is a real number.
        If |y1 - y2| <= (|f(z) - y1| )
        and (|f(z) - y1| ) <= e + e then 
        |y1 - y2| <=  e + e.  
        Proof.
          For every real number x',y',z'
          if x' <= y' and y' <= z' then x' <= z'.
          |y1 - y2| is a real number.
          (|f(z) - y1| ) is a real number.
          e + e is a real number.
        end.
      end.
      |y1 - y2| <= (|f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|)
      and (|f(z) - y1| + |f(z) -  y2|) <= e + e.
    End.  
    e + e = (1+1)*e.
  end.
  Therefore the thesis (by Fredy). Indeed (1+1) is a positive real number.
QED.
