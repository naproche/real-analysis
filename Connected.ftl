Definition. Let X be a set. Let A, B be subsets of X. Int(A,B,X)={x | x is an element of A and x
 is an element of B}.

Definition. Let a and b be extended real numbers. Intv(a,b)={c | (c is an extended real number) and
(c >> a) and (c<<b)}.

#We will define connected for the real line. For a general definition look for the file continuity_pre.

Definition. Let a and b be extended real numbers. Cintv(a,b) = {c | (c is an extender real number) and
(c >>= a) and (c<<=b)}.
